Serial Port rxtx library

Version 2.2.2:
 - initial release - same as https://github.com/bartprokop/rxtx
 
This is an attemp to revive the old but very good rxtx library that allows for using serial ports in Java. I was using rxtx 2.1.7 for many years. But as my projects have evolved from IDE build through ant to Maven and JDK from 1.1 to 1.8 this was aparent that rxtx is unmaintained. So i tried to get the sources (now not easilly avaiable) of latest stable version (stable in terms of used in many production system) and continue that great piece of software on github.
